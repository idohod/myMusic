First you get a rhythm. Then you get a list of files in a specific folder (change the address according to your folder). Choose a file from the list or create a new file. In the case of selecting an existing file, you can choose whether to continue writing the new rhythm and transition from the same place where the previous one left off or to start from the beginning (and delete the previous one). The beat will be written between one and four times (chosen randomly). Finally, choose an index until which the rhythm you received before will remain and from which the transition will begin.
Now you can create as many rhythms, transitions and whole musical sections as you want!
